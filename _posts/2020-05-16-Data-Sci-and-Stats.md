title: Data Science and Statistics

## What do you think being a data scientist is about?

Being a data scientist is about applying knowledge about statistics, software engineering, and domain knowledge to data in order to solve business problems.

## What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

The major duties of a data scientist include:
- Understanding of how data relates to the problem at hand
- Data cleansing and preparation
- Statistical model training and validation
- Creating an automated pipeline for the above steps
- Communicating model assumptions and results

## What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

### Similarities

Data scientists and statisticians use data, exploratory analysis, and model building to answer questions or solve problems. They both have at least a basic understanding of statistics, their relation to data, and use software programs in their analysis. Both are able to explain the assumptions and results of their models.

### Differences

Statisticians have a deeper understanding of validating assumptions and the mathematics behind modeling techniques, while data scientists can develop end-to-end pipelines to ingest large amounts of data to predict results.

Statisticians typically work with data captured from surveys or experiments, and are involved in data collection to verify that the assumptions of the model they are planning to use are not violated. They use simpler models such as linear regression, and usually are trying to answer questions or provide analysis about data captured in the past.

Data scientists are not as involved in the data collection or as concerned about violated assumptions in data collection. They are usually provided large data sets and use a variety of different algorithms to try and find a model that best predicts the data. Data scientists have a deeper knowledge of the domain that the problem is in and can tune their models based on that knowledge. They typically work on models that can be updated as soon as new data comes in, and that provide predictions based on past observations.

## How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

As a software developer, I fall more on the data scientist side of the spectrum, but understand the importance of having a solid foundation in statistics. Creating models may be easy for someone with strong programming skills, but without knowledge of the problem or an understanding of the assumptions a model makes about the data, the results can be misleading and generalize poorly.
