title: Thoughts on R Programming

## What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?

I don't claim to be an expert on R, but from my limited usage of it, it seems to be a stable programming language, with plenty of features targeted towards statisticians and data scientists. It's not as general purpose as languages such as C, C++, Python, or Java, but rather seems like it's operating in the same market space as some SAS 9 products, such as SAS/STAT and SAS/GRAPH. It may not be quite as full-featured as other object-oriented languages such as Java or C++, but R offers a modern programming syntax which is familiar for users coming from other popular, general-purpose languages.

## What functionality do you like about R?

R allows users to get up and running quickly. There are some good sample data sets (though they can be scattered across packages), the syntax is relatively simple to understand, the object-oriented aspects make operations on data easier, and there is a plethora of useful packages to sift through to help accomplish tasks.

I really like that there are reporting mechanisms built in, such as R Markdown for embedding R code, plots, and results directly into documents using simple Markdown syntax. R Studio makes it easy for users to generate these reports.

## What parts do you miss about your other language?

I wish R had stricter typing for objects; while it is not as loose as JavaScript, it feels like it lines up closer to Python with regard to how it assigns types to objects. I think that loose typing makes code difficult to read and can easily cause confusion when debugging issues.

I also wish R had more consistent syntax across packages. Without this consistency, there is additional cognitive load that users have to take on in order to solve already complex problems. That extra effort that's expended trying to understand minor syntactical differences can become burdensome not only when first writing the code, but also whenever the code is referenced in future (by the author or by other readers).

## Do you consider R a difficult language to learn?

R leans more towards being a scripting language than a programming language. It follows some of the same general principles and logical operators as other general-purpose languages, such as C++, Java, and Python. For these reasons, I don't think R is a difficult language to learn, especially for those with prior programming experience in some other general-purpose language. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a foray into programming for a beginner due to the inconsistent syntax in many widely-used packages.
