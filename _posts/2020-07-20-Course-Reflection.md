## Thoughts on Data Scientists

From my [initial post](https://jubilant.me/stat-blog/Data-Sci-and-Stats/), I don't think much has changed about the role that a data scientist fills. Data Scientists are a blend between statisticians and software engineers. This course has given me a deeper appreciation for the statistical background that underlies data science. It's also given me a better understanding of the problem of feature engineering and the curse of dimensionality when dealing with wide data sets.

## Using R for Data Science

R is a neat language for doing data science on small data sets. I really enjoyed learning about packages in the `tidyverse` and using `ggplot` and Shiny to create enticing visualizations. The reference books by Hadley Wickham are outstanding and make learning about R easy. I think R with R Studio is easier than Python for doing exploratory data analysis. I still prefer using SAS products for most data sets, but the obvious advantage of R or Python is that they're freely available and have wide community support.

## Things I'll Change in Practice

I'd like to get more experience using R Shiny for sports analytics. Using an interactive interface would make exploring that data much easier and would be really interesting to do!

I'd also like to apply some of this knowledge to my work at SAS. Our CAS actions are accessible in R, so I'd like to see if I can create some image analysis pipelines for computer vision using R to call those actions.
