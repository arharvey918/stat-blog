## How is the course going so far?

The course is going well so far. It doesn't necessarily go deep into topics, but seems like it provides a good survey of the analysis methods and general technologies that a data scientist has to work with on a daily basis. Overall, I'm enjoying the course and am learning new things.

## What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?

Specifically, I like that the course is exposing me to so many different technologies and how to work with them in R. Even though I was aware of most of them before this class, I hadn't done much work pulling them all together, nor worked with them in R. I've also enjoyed primarily working with the packages provided in the `tidyverse`. I've done R programming in the past, but using the `tidyverse` packages and reading through the R for Data Science book has provided me with a more "clean" approach for writing R code.

I think that freedom to choose your own data set in projects would be a cool addition to this course. For example, in project 1, we used NHL data. However, if students were allowed to choose a data set that they found personally interesting, it may provide extra motivation for them to ask meaningful questions about the data and result in some interesting insights. I took a course in machine learning a few years ago that utilized this approach and really enjoyed working with an NFL data set I scraped! It ended up being one of my favorite courses not just because of the knowledge I gained, but because I had been able to apply it to something that I was passionate about, and get feedback from my professor and TAs on it.

## Any other thoughts?  (I just like to hear how everyone is doing and get feedback to incorporate!

I'm really enjoying the course style and content. The R for Data Science book is really well written, and the format of the lecture videos is also easy to follow and consumable. I've been following along so far by taking notes in RMarkdown myself. It would be nice if the RMarkdown source for the slides was made available in addition to the HTML output that is already available. The only negative I've noticed (from my biased perspective) is that the homework grading can be a little nit-picky. Overall, I'm enjoying the course and look forward to the second half!
